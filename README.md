## About Me
- Computer Information Systems student at the University of the Fraser Valley (Canada).
- Build intelligent systems that combine AI, ML, and full-stack engineering for real-world impact.
- Enjoy fast iteration: ship prototypes, measure, refine.

## What I Build
- AI routing systems such as ContextOS (multi-model AI router demo).
- ML pipelines for vision and NLP (face recognition, spam classifier).
- Real-time computer vision apps with OpenCV and InsightFace.
- Fast, clean backend APIs with FastAPI.
- Security research and IoT assessments.

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python | JavaScript | Java | C | SQL | Bash  
**Frameworks/Libraries:** FastAPI | Streamlit | Node.js | OpenCV | scikit-learn | InsightFace | TensorFlow | Keras  
**Databases/Tools:** Firebase | MongoDB | SQLite | Docker | Postman | Git

## Featured Work
- **ContextOS - AI Router Demo:** Multi-model routing engine that picks the best model (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Ollama) using a model registry and adapter pattern.
- **Face Recognition System:** InsightFace embeddings with SVM calibration and a Streamlit dashboard supporting live camera, registration, and labeled database search.
- **Meeting Minutes Generator:** Audio -> transcription -> summaries -> action items for lectures, meetings, and interviews.
- **Email Spam Classifier:** Linear SVM trained on the Kaggle spam dataset with TF-IDF features.
- **Stock Price Predictor:** LSTM/Prophet experiments for short-horizon forecasts with feature engineering and backtesting.
- **IoT Security Assessment:** Firmware reversing, Shodan scans, threat modeling, and vulnerability reporting.
